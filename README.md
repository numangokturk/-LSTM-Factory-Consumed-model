Project Description
This project aims to develop energy consumption forecasting models by analyzing electricity usage data from an industrial company. The company manufactures various types of coils, steel plates, and iron plates, with electricity consumption data stored in a cloud-based system. Additionally, energy consumption information sourced from the Korea Electric Power Corporation website (pccs.kepco.go.kr) has been analyzed on daily, monthly, and annual bases.

Dataset and Preparation
The dataset comprises electricity consumption data derived from the companyâ€™s production processes. Initially, the dataset was preprocessed, with missing or inconsistent data cleaned and structured for analysis.

Developed Models
Four distinct LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models were trained to predict energy consumption. Their performance was evaluated using success metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE), and the results were visualized for comparison. Furthermore, machine learning approaches were explored, with Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms employed to develop additional predictive models. These were benchmarked against the LSTM models to identify the most effective approach.

Objective and Contribution
The study seeks to enhance operational efficiency and optimize energy management through accurate energy consumption forecasting. By sharing these models and analyses on GitHub, the goal is to inspire and guide researchers and professionals working on similar projects. # -LSTM-Factory-Consumed-model
